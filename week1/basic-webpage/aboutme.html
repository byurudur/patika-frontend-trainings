            I am a graduate of Materials Engineering. I took part in many projects in this field and did research and internships. <br>However, my curiosity and passion led me to the world of software. The reason behind stepping into the software industry was my desire to acquire new skills in the rapidly developing world of technology and my desire to further improve myself in this field.

My transition to the software world offers the opportunity to use my analytical thinking skills, problem-solving ability and creative approach. <br>My materials engineering experience has built my sensitivity to details and discipline on solid foundations. Now, I aim to be successful in new projects by working with the same meticulousness in the software field.

I am excitedly looking for new opportunities to make my name known in the software world and further develop my skills. With my tendency towards teamwork and my desire to learn, I am here to add value to every project. Currently, I have participated in the Fullstack Java Bootcamp in the Patika.dev school's Patika+ program.
