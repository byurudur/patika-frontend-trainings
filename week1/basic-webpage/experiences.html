        <li><b>BISAN Bicycle & Motorbikes</b>
           
        <p><i>I have experienced the absolute unique working style with kaizen and yamazumi in Bisan Motor Company.</i></p>
        <p>I worked as a full-time intern in a company where lean production techniques were applied and pipe cutting, welding, powder coating and assembly operations were carried out. I also took part as a team member in different kaizen projects.
            I learned business management and planning in these projects. I worked in CNC lathe, welding, assembly line, quality control analysis. I worked in the planning department using MS Excel.</p>
